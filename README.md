## Welcome To EduFI
### Welcome To EduFi the education portal of the future.

**Your tasks, if you decide to complete them are to:**
<li>Create a student transfer page that will transfer one student from one school to another. If the student has an enrollment display a message letting the user know the student cannot be moved because he or she has an active enrollment.</li>
<li>Run the controller tests and fix all the tests that are currently erroring.</li>
<li>Bonus one: feel free to refactor any code or architectural decision you think could be improved.</li>
<li>Bonus two: Integrate the Google Maps API, or any other MAP api to show a map of the School based on its location.</li>
<b>Good luck.</b>

**Notes:**
<b>Please work on this repo, committing your work. When complete please zip the repo back up and email it to jwindholtz@everfi.com</b>
<b>Preferrably try to complete this within 7 days of receipt.  Please don't spend more then 2 hours on this take home project.

## My Notes:

- [ ] Create a student transfer page that will transfer one student from one school to another.
- [ ] If the student has an enrollment display a message letting the user know the student cannot be moved because he or she has an active enrollment.
- [ ] Fix tests that are currently erroring

Plan:
Create a transfer object that belongs to both student and schools

The object relationships:
belongs to school (destination school id)
belongs to student (student id)

Routes:
	students/id/transfers/new
	students/id/transfers/create
	students/id/transfers
	
Story
Student 'John Not-eligible', is enrolled at school "Test School" and has an active enrollment.
Student 'Mary Eligible' is enrolled at school "Test School" and she doesn't have active enrollments.

1. A student goes to her show page where she finds link labelled "Transfer to a new school"
	1.a. Clicking on the "Transfer..." link redirects to new view for transfer
	1.b. Transfer new view has a form that includes:
		- Name
		- School of origin
		- Eligible to transfer?
		- Destination school
		- Cohort
		- Start date
		- End date
		- Submit 
	1.c. Clicking submit 
			- Creates an enrollment in the new school (if eligible)
			- redirects to student show page if student eligible. Student can see new enrollment		
			- flash message error and re-renders page if student is not eligible. Student can see new enrollment
