**Your tasks, if you decide to complete them are to:**
<li>Create a student transfer page that will transfer one student from one school to another. If the student has an enrollment display a message letting the user know the student cannot be moved because he or she has an active enrollment.</li>
<li>Run the controller tests and fix all the tests that are currently erroring.</li>
<li>Bonus one: feel free to refactor any code or architectural decision you think could be improved.</li>
<li>Bonus two: Integrate the Google Maps API, or any other MAP api to show a map of the School based on its location.</li>
<b>Good luck.</b>
